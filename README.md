Creating Touch Icons
------------
* Android
On Android there’s a few different ways to achieve this. Thanks to philwilson.org for both these methods:

    Bookmark the page you want to add to a home screen
    Go to the home screen you want to add the link/bookmark to
    Long-press in an empty space to bring up the “Add to Home Screen” menu
    Select “Shortcuts”
    Select “Bookmark”
    Choose the bookmark you’ve just created

Depending on your device and version of Android, this may work:

    Bookmark the page you want to add to a home screen
    Open the browser “bookmarks” screen
    Long-press the bookmark you want
    Select “Add to Home screen”

* Chrome on Android
New in Chrome M31 Beta, you can set up your web app to have an application shortcut icon added to a device's homescreen, and have the app launch in full-screen "app mode" using Chrome for Android’s "Add to homescreen" menu item.

* IOS
Using an iOS device to add a website bookmark to the home screen is very simple. Visit the website you want to bookmark then click the icon that looks like a box with an arrow jumping out of it (this also lets you tweet, print or mail the page you’re on). Click ‘Add to Home Screen’.
